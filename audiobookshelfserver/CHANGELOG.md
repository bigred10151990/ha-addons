## 2.28.0

- Updated version to match Audiobookshelfs version.
- Fixed addon so it can be installed from the repo. Original development was done locally and had an issues with pulling the wrong base Audiobookshelf image version.
- There was probably a better way to fix it but it works now.
- Going forward i will keep the version number of the addon matched to Audiobookshelf. 

## 1.0.1

- Initial release
